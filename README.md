#### Notes
Instead of using a library for the carousel I decided to give it a try using the css scroll-snap method. In the first interview I had said I wanted to try it but never found the opportunity to use it so I thought this is as good a time as any. I would've liked to animate it more but being cautious of time I left it as is, with just some slight transitions on the buttons and header links.
